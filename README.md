Conversions.c = the incorrect version of this assignment. I had originally thought I needed actual decimal numbers for the conversions, but then after researching decimals to binary to hexadecimals, it told me I needed int values. There is a working conversion for both binary and hexadecimal, just no shifting or masking. 

Conversions2.c = the correct version of this assignment!
